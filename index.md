#Sources for Final Paper
##Katharina Elberti

###Article One

####My first article's main focus is on career advancement and how in this day and age everyone needs to be able to do every aspect.  It's not saying "go back to school, be an expert, make 100% of all your own things," but it outlines how if you have an idea for a new product/ap/design/etc it would be beneficial for you to be able to have the basic skillset to create a prototype.  This direct quote from the article sums it up rather well: "If someone in marketing or finance or HR has an idea for a new app, they should be able to take matters in their own hands."  I plan to use this article to talk about the doors coding can open up to individuals regardless of their career.  Coding is not something that's limited to computer science majors or computer engineers: the skills are transferable and useful in all fields.  I enjoyed this article because I thought it was well written and it approached the topic in an entertaining manner.

###Article Two

####My second article I will be using as a source is entitled "8 Reasons Everyone Should Learn How To Code" from clickhole.com.  The article outlines the reason why people who are computer science majors or coders by trade should still learn the basics of coding.  The reasons the author gives are as follows: You get to italicize text without having to call a professional; potential employers will start jumping in front of your car; you get to spend more time with your computer; doctors will treat you like an equal; you will understand whatâ€™s happened when your banking info is stolen; you will meet girls with colored hair; you will be able to run 3D simulations of a praying mantis getting smashed by a Bible; you can code Theresa back to life.

####Each reason - in the article - delves more into specifics.  While at first I disregarded this article as kind of dumb, I realized - after reading the reasonings and getting past the random names given to each reason - that the base points were very solid.  I'm going to use this source in my paper to help make a somewhat more plain topic lively.  I'm going to use the facts to engage readers who are not coders and make the information - how to make a website, how to format with Bootstrap - more relevant to them.

###Article Three

####My final article is called "Benefits of Learning Coding" from codeconquest.com.  The main focus of the article is to talk about the benefits of you professionals having the ability to create their own websites.  While generators such as Weebly, WordPress, and Wix are useful and can get the job done, being able to create your own site from scratch and truly put your own design aspects into it is priceless.  While generators can probably get very close to your vision of a personal site, when you're given a blank canvas you're truly free to create anything you imagine.

####The article also talks about how coding is not just "let's make a website."  Coding gives you the skills to better write memos and emails through Markdown.  It allows you to format things in different ways that aren't possible on just Word documents.  Not only can you write them differently, when saving them it gives you the freedom to have them on multiple mediums.  I am going to use this article to talk about the non-coding benefits of learning coding.  What I mean by this is how day-to-day tasks can be altered and made simplar or more streamlined.
